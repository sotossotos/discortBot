# Discord Bot

---

## Preface

This is a mock-up type of project solely to delve into the Discord API through Discord.py. The ***mp3 files are not open for free use*** since it has recordings of a specific person. The code itself it's open for everyone to fork and tweak or extend further. Mainly, aiming to entertain with a peculiar type of humour a close community. One would question the merit of this project, quarantine just provides such opportunities.
